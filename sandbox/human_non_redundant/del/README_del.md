# Introduction

The non-redundant structural variants, "nr SVs", of type "deletion" are in two 
files on the FTP site:

del/all_nr_GRCh37_aggregated_deletion_loss.tsv
del/all_nr_GRCh38_aggregated_deletion_loss.tsv

The variant types in the NR "aggregated deletions and losses" file are:

* alu_deletion
* copy_number_loss
* deletion
* line1_deletion
* sva_deletion

# Records in the aggregated_deletion_loss files 

Records in the aggregated_deletion_loss files contain the following tab-separated fields.

| chr | outermost_start | outermost_stop | SV_count | variant_type | method | analysis | platform | study | SV |


## Example record 1:

chr | outermost_start | outermost_stop | SV_count | variant_type | method | analysis | platform | study | SV 
----|------------------|----------------|----------|--------------|--------|----------|----------|-------|---
1 | 10001 | 1535693 | 1  | deletion  | Oligo_aCGH  | Probe_signal_intensity | NA  | Boone2013  | nssv1614481

### Explanation:

* The non-redundant coordinates for this record in dbVar are chr1, with
an outermost start of 10001 and outermost stop of 1535693.

* The SV_count of 1 indicates there is only one SV with an exact match to the 
given placement.  This count does not include SVs with a partial match.

* The variant_call_type is "deletion".

* The method of "Oligo_aCGH" and the analysis of "Probe_signal_intensity" 
indicate how the one variant was evaluated.

* NA indicates the no platform was specified this one deletion variant.

* Boone2013 is the study name as found in dbVar.

* The dbVar variant_accession is "nssv1614481".

* URLs using the study name or variant_accession can be created to access the data
in dbVar, e.g.:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar/?term=Boone2013  
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar/?term=nssv1614481

* From the latter page you may click on the "Variant Region ID" on the left to see
the variant's region in the NCBI Variation Viewer at:

## Example record 2:

chr | outermost_start | outermost_stop | SV_count | variant_type | method | analysis | platform | study | SV 
----|------------------|----------------|----------|--------------|--------|----------|----------|-------|---
1 | 72300544 | 72346418 | 7 | copy_number_loss;deletion | Oligo_aCGH;Sequencing | Probe_signal_intensity;Read_depth | Agilent 24M aCGH;Illumina IIx | Park2010;Ju2010 | nssv1423530:nssv1425248:nssv1428032:nssv1428830:nssv1434173:nssv1439464:nssv1420391

### Explanation:

* This is a more complicated example deletion NR record containing multiple 
variants with multiple types, methods, and analyses from multiple studies, using 
multiple platforms.
